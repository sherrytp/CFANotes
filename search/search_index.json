Which of the following is least likely a change in cash flow from operations under U.S. GAAP?</p> <p>A. A decrease in notes payable. (this is a financing cash flow)</p> <p>B. An increase in interest expense.</p> <p>C. An increase in accounts payable.</p> <p>1. Continental Corporation reported sales revenue of \\$150,000 for the current year. If accounts receivable decreased \\$10,000 during the year and accounts payable increased \\$4,000 during the year, cash collections were: A. \\$154,000. B. \\$160,000. C. \\$164,000.</p> <ul> <li>\\$150,000 sales + \\$10,000 decrease in accounts receivable =     \\$160,000 cash collections. The change in accounts payable does not     affect cash collections. Accounts payable result from a firm's     purchases from its suppliers. (Module 25.3, LOS 25.f, 25.g)</li> </ul> <p>6. A company's current ratio is 1.9. If some of accounts payable are paid off from cash account:</p> <p>A. numerator would decrease by a greater percentage than the denominator, resulting in a lower current ratio.</p> <p>B. denominator would decrease by a greater percentage than the numerator, resulting in a higher current ratio.</p> <p>C. numerator and denominator would decrease proportionally, leaving the current ratio unchanged.</p> <ul> <li>Current ratio=CA/CL. If cash (a current asset) and AP (a current     liability) decrease by same amount and current ratio is greater than     1, then the numerator decreases less in percentage terms than the     denominator, and current ratio increases. (Module 26.2, LOS 26.b)</li> </ul> <p>7. A company's quick ratio is 1.2. If inventory were purchased for cash, the:</p> <p>A. numerator would decrease more than the denominator, resulting in a lower quick ratio.</p> <p>B. denominator would decrease more than the numerator, resulting in a higher current ratio.</p> <p>C. numerator and denominator would decrease proportionally, leaving the current ratio unchanged.</p> <ul> <li>Quick ratio = (cash + marketable securities + AR) / CL, not of     inventory. (Module 26.2, LOS 26.b)</li> </ul> <p>3. An analyst who needs to model and forecast a company's earnings for the next three years would be least likely to:</p> <p>A. assume that key financial ratios will remain unchanged for the forecast period.</p> <p>B. use common-size financial statements to estimate expenses as a percentage of [net income]NO, but of SALES.</p> <p>C. examine the variability of the predicted outcomes by performing a sensitivity or scenario analysis.</p> <p>2. In a period of falling prices, a firm reporting under LIFO, compared to reporting under FIFO, will have a higher: A. cost of sales. B. gross profit margin. C. inventory turnover ratio.</p> <ul> <li>With falling prices, LIFO COGS will include the cost of lower priced     inventory and COGS will be less when compared to FIFO COGS. Because     of this, the firm would report a higher gross profit margin under     LIFO than under FIFO, while LIFO inventory will be higher and     inventory turnover lower. (LOS 27.d)</li> </ul> <p>3. Compared to reporting under FIFO for both tax and financial statements, a firm that chooses to report under LIFO during a period of falling prices would be most likely to report a lower:</p> <p>A. inventory. B. gross profit. C. cash balance.</p> <ul> <li>When prices are falling, LIFO would result in lower COGS (higher     gross profit) and higher ending inventory than FIFO. Higher gross     profit with LIFO would result in higher taxes payable which would     reduce cash balances (as long they pay their taxes). (LOS 27.d)</li> </ul> <p>2. Bangor Company discloses that its LIFO reserve was \\$625,000 at the end of the previous year and \\$675,000 at the end of the current year. For the current year, beginning inventory was \\$2,350,000 and ending inventory was \\$2,525,000. The firm's tax rate is 30%. What would Bangor's ending inventory have been using FIFO? A. \\$2,575,000. B. \\$2,997,500. C.\\$3,200,000.</p> <p>FIFO inventory = LIFO inventory + LIFO reserve = \\$2,525,000 + \\$675,000 = \\$3,200,000, but I calculated the difference between LIFO reserves. (LOS 27.f)</p> <p>2. According to U.S. GAAP, an asset is impaired when:</p> <p>A. firm cannot fully recover the carrying amount of asset through operations.</p> <p>B. accumulated depreciation plus salvage value exceeds acquisition cost.</p> <p>C. present value of future cash flows from an asset exceeds it carrying value.</p> <ul> <li>An asset is impaired when the firm cannot recover carrying value, C     recoverability is tested based on undiscounted future cash flows.     (LOS 28.i)</li> </ul> <p>3. In the year after an impairment charge on a finite-lived identifiable intangible asset, compared to not taking the charge, net income is most likely to be: A. lower. B. higher. C. unaffected.</p> <ul> <li>Because a finite-lived identifiable intangible asset would be     amortized, amortization expense in the year after the reduction from     the impairment charge would be lower (the carrying value of the     asset would most likely be lower), increasing net income. (LOS 28.i)</li> </ul> <p>3. A firm owns a warehouse that it [rents out]{.ul}. Under IFRS, the firm may report the value of this asset on its balance sheet using:</p> <p>A. the cost model or the fair value model.</p> <p>B. the cost model or the revaluation model.</p> <p>C. the revaluation model or the fair value model.</p> <ul> <li>\u533a\u5206revaluation\u8ddffair value model\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9700\u8981rent out forrental     gains\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5176\u5b9e\u662finvestment property - cost or fair value method     under IFRS.</li> </ul> <p>3. An analyst is comparing a firm to its competitors. The firm has a deferred tax liability that results from accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. The firm is expected to continue to grow in the foreseeable future. How should the liability be treated for analysis purposes?</p> <p>A. It should be treated as equity at its full value.</p> <p>B. It should be treated as a liability at its full value.</p> <p>C. The present value should be treated as a liability with the remainder being treated as equity.</p> <ul> <li>The DTL is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future because     a growing firm is expected to continue to increase its investment in     depreciable assets, and accelerated depreciation for tax on the     newly acquired assets delays the reversal of the DTL. (Module 29.2,     LOS 29.b)</li> </ul> <p>10. For analytical purposes, what is the impact on the debt-to-equity ratio if the market rate of interest increases after the bond is issued? A. An increase. B. A decrease. C. No change.</p> <ul> <li>An increase in the market rate will decrease the price of a bond.     For analytical purposes, adjusting the bond liability to its     economic value will result in a lower debt-to-equity ratio (lower     numerator and higher denominator). (Module 30.2, LOS 30.b)</li> </ul> <p>2. The purpose of debt covenants is best described as:</p> <p>A. limiting issuance costs.</p> <p>B. preventing technical default.</p> <p>C. protecting the interests of creditors.</p> <ul> <li>A bond is considered to be in \"technical\" default if the borrower     violates the bond's covenants</li> </ul> <p>3. Which of the following is least likely to be disclosed in the financial statements of a bond issuer? A. The amount of debt that matures in each of the next five years.</p> <p>B. Collateral pledged as security in the event of default.</p> <p>C. The market rate of interest on the balance sheet date.</p> <ul> <li>The market rate on the balance sheet date is not typically     disclosed. The amount of debt principal scheduled to be repaid over     the next five years and collateral pledged (if any) are generally     included in the footnotes to the financial statements. (LOS 30.e)</li> </ul> <p>2. Under IFRS 16, a lease for a period of more than one year may be classified as an operating lease by: A. lessors only. B. lessees only. C. both lessors and lessees.</p> <ul> <li>Under IFRS 16, lessors may classify leases as operating or finance     leases, but lessees must treat all leases longer than one year as     finance leases.(Module 30.4, LOS 30.h)</li> </ul> <p>3. At the beginning of 20X6, Cougar Corporation enters a finance lease requiring five annual payments of \\$10,000 each beginning on the first day of the lease. Assuming the lease interest rate is 8%, the amount of interest expense recognized by Cougar in 20X6 is closest to:</p> <p>A. \\$2,650. B. \\$3,194. C. \\$3,450.</p> <ul> <li>At the inception of the lease, the present value of the lease     payments is \\$43,121 (BGN mode: N = 5, I = 8, PMT = 10,000, FV = 0,     solve for PV). After the first payment is made, the balance of the     lease liability is \\$43,121 -- 10,000 principal payment = \\$33,121.

Operating leases: lessor derecognizes underlying asset and     recognizes lease receipts as income&amp;BS lease invest/R.</p> </li> <li> <p>Under US GAAP, a lessor classifies a finance lease in one of three     categories: sales-type(PV of lease payment&gt;carrying value),     direct financing(PV pmt=carrying), or operating; IFRS x     diff. The lessor's classification and accounting for operating     leases under US GAAP is similar to that under IFRS. For both     sales-type and direct financing leases, the lessor derecognizes the     underlying asset and recognizes a lease receivable; however, the     lessor recognizes selling profit only if the lease is considered a     sales-type lease. For lessee accounting, the distinction between     finance leases and operating leases exists in US GAAP but not in     IFRS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operating lease is an off-balance-sheet, cuz appear neither in A     nor L. Adjustment for operating leases is to treat them as capital     leases by estimating present value of future lease obligations and     adding that value to the firm's liabilities and long-lived assets.     In finance lease, inception of lease is lower of PV of future min     lease pmt or fair value of leased asset; interest rate used by     lessee is lower of incremental borrowing rate or lessor\\'s implicit     rate; interest CFO, principal CFF</p> </li> </ul> <p>I.

An     underfunded (fair value of plan\\'s asset &gt; estimated pension     obligation) defined benefit pension plan is shown as a non-current     net pension liability. Defined contribution plan: amount of     contribution into the plan is specified (i.e., defined) and the     amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the) plan (received by     the retiree depends on the performance of the plan's assets, payment     record as pension expense.
