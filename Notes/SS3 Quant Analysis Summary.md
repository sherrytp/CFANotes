-   Time-series data consists of [observations measured over a period of
    time]{.ul}, spaced at uniform intervals. The monthly returns on a
    particular stock over the last 5 years are an example of time-series
    data.

-   Cross-sectional data refers to [data collected by observing many
    subjects (such as individuals, firms, or countries/regions) at the
    same point in time]{.ul}. Analysis of cross-sectional data usually
    consists of comparing the differences among the subjects. The
    returns of individual stocks over the last year are an example of
    cross-sectional data.

> Data sets can have both time-series and cross-sectional data in them.
> Examples of such data sets are:

-   **Longitudinal** data, which is data collected over time about
    [multiple characteristics of the same observational unit]{.ul}. The
    various economic indicators---unemployment levels, inflation, GDP
    growth rates (multiple characteristics) of a particular country
    (observational unit) over a decade (period of time) are examples of
    longitudinal data.

-   **Panel** data, which refers to data collected over time about [a
    single characteristic of multiple observational units]{.ul}. The
    unemployment rate (single characteristic) o=f a number of countries
    (multiple observational units) over time are examples of panel data.
