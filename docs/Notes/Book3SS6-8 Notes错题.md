> C. enforcing compliance with financial reporting standards only.

-   Standard-setting bodies are private-sector org that establish
    standards; enforcement is responsibility of regulatory authorities.

> 2\. Are income taxes and cost of goods sold examples of expenses
> classified by nature or classified by function in the income
> statement?

-   **Income taxes** are expenses grouped together by their **nature**.
    **Cost of goods sold** includes a number of expenses related to the
    same **function**, the production of inventory.

>  
>
> 3\. Which of the following is least likely a condition necessary for

>
> A. Cash has been collected.
>
> **B**. The goods have been delivered.
>
> C. The price has been determined.

>  
>
> 6\. A manufacturing firm sells a large amount of precision parts and

> The firm should recognize revenue from this transaction:
>
> A. at the time of the sale.
>
> B. using the installment method.
>
> C. proportionally as payments are received.

-   For credit sales to its customers, the firm can recognize revenue at
    the time of the sale. The installment method would be appropriate if
    collectability could not be estimated reliably, and the cost
    recovery method would be appropriate if collectability was highly
    uncertain.

>
> **B**. Unusual or infrequent items are reported before taxes above net
> income from continuing operations.
>
> C. A change in accounting principle is reported in the income
> statement net of taxes after extraordinary items and before net
> income.

-   A change in accounting principle requires retrospective application;
    that is, all prior period financial statements currently presented
    are restated to reflect the change. (LOS 23.f)

-   The Hall Corporation had 100,000 shares of common stock outstanding
    at the beginning of the year. Hall issued 30,000 shares of common
    stock on May 1. On July 1, the company issued a 10% stock dividend.
    On September 1, Hall issued 1,000, 10% bonds, each convertible into
    21 shares of common stock. What is the weighted average number of
    shares to be used in computing basic and diluted EPS, assuming the
    convertible bonds are dilutive?

> The new stock is weighted by 8 / 12. The bonds are weighted by 4 / 12
> and are not affected by the stock dividend. (1. LOS 23.h, 23.i)
>
> Basic shares = {\[100,000 × (12 / 12)\] + \[30,000 × (8 / 12)\]} ×

> 3\. Which of the following transactions affects owners' equity but
> does not affect net income?
>
> A. Foreign currency translation gain.
>
> **B**. Repaying the face amount on a bond issued at par.
>
> C. Dividends received from available-for-sale securities.

-   A foreign currency translation gain is not included in net income
    but increases owners' equity. Dividends received are reported in the
    income statement, included in net income. The repayment of principal
    does not affect owners' equity.(LOS 23.l, 23.m) Dividends paid \|
    reacquisition of common stock are transactions with shareholders,
    not included in comprehensive income.

>
> B. Shareholders' equity is equal to the intrinsic value of the firm.
>
> C. The balance sheet can be used to measure the firm's capital

-   The capital structure is measured by the mix of debt and equity(in
    BS) used to finance the business. (Module 24.2, LOS 24.b)

>
> B. Revenue is recognized to the extent that costs have been incurred.
>
> C. Revenue is deferred until the sporting event is held.

-   The ticket revenue should not be recognized until it is earned. Even
    though the tickets are nonrefundable, the seller is still obligated
    to hold the event.

-   2\. At the beginning of the year, Parent Company purchased all
    500,000 shares of Sub Incorporated for \$15 per share. Just before
    the acquisition date, Sub's balance sheet reported net assets of \$6
    million. Parent determined the fair value of Sub's property and
    equipment was \$1 million higher than reported by Sub. What amount
    of goodwill should Parent report as a result of its acquisition of
    Sub? Purchase price of \$7,500,000 \[\$15 per share × 500,000
    shares\] -- fair value of net assets of \$7,000,000 \[\$6,000,000
    book value + \$1,000,000 increase in property and equipment\] =
    goodwill of \$500,000, not \$1,500,000. (Module 24.5, LOS 24.e)

> 1\. Continental Corporation reported sales revenue of \$150,000 for
> the current year. If accounts receivable decreased \$10,000 during the
> year and accounts payable increased \$4,000 during the year, cash
> collections were: A. \$154,000. B. \$160,000. C. \$164,000.

-   \$150,000 sales + \$10,000 decrease in accounts receivable =
    \$160,000 cash collections. The change in accounts payable does not
    affect cash collections. Accounts payable result from a firm's
    purchases from its suppliers. (Module 25.3, LOS 25.f, 25.g)

> 6\. A company's current ratio is 1.9. If some of accounts payable are

>
> B. denominator would decrease by a greater percentage than the

>
> C. numerator and denominator would decrease proportionally, leaving
> the current ratio unchanged.

-   Current ratio=CA/CL. If cash (a current asset) and AP (a current
    liability) decrease by same amount and current ratio is greater than
    1, then the numerator decreases less in percentage terms than the
    denominator, and current ratio increases. (Module 26.2, LOS 26.b)

>
> B. denominator would decrease more than the numerator, resulting in a
> higher current ratio.
>
> **C**. numerator and denominator would decrease proportionally,
> leaving the current ratio unchanged.

-   Quick ratio = (cash + marketable securities + AR) / CL, not of
    inventory. (Module 26.2, LOS 26.b)

> 2\. In a period of falling prices, a firm reporting under LIFO,
> compared to reporting under FIFO, will have a higher: **A**. cost of
> sales. B. gross profit margin. C. inventory turnover ratio.

-   With falling prices, LIFO COGS will include the cost of lower priced
    inventory and COGS will be less when compared to FIFO COGS. Because
    of this, the firm would report a higher gross profit margin under
    LIFO than under FIFO, while LIFO inventory will be higher and
    inventory turnover lower. (LOS 27.d)

>  
>
> 3\. Compared to reporting under FIFO for both tax and financial
> statements, a firm that chooses to report under LIFO during a period
> of falling prices would be most likely to report a lower:
>
> A. inventory. **B**. gross profit. C. cash balance.

-   When prices are falling, LIFO would result in lower COGS (higher
    gross profit) and higher ending inventory than FIFO. Higher gross
    profit with LIFO would result in higher taxes payable which would
    reduce cash balances (as long they pay their taxes). (LOS 27.d)

> 2\. According to U.S. GAAP, an asset is impaired when:
>
> A. firm cannot fully recover the carrying amount of asset through
> operations.
>
> B. accumulated depreciation plus salvage value exceeds acquisition
> cost.
>
> **C**. present value of future cash flows from an asset exceeds it
> carrying value.

-   An asset is impaired when the firm cannot recover carrying value, C
    recoverability is tested based on undiscounted future cash flows.
    (LOS 28.i)

>  
>
> 3\. In the year after an impairment charge on a finite-lived
> identifiable intangible asset, compared to not taking the charge, net
> income is most likely to be: **A. lower**. B. higher. C. unaffected.

-   Because a finite-lived identifiable intangible asset would be
    amortized, amortization expense in the year after the reduction from
    the impairment charge would be lower (the carrying value of the
    asset would most likely be lower), increasing net income. (LOS 28.i)

>

>
> A. the cost model or the fair value model.
>
> B. the cost model or the revaluation model.
>
> C. the revaluation model or the fair value model.

-   区分revaluation跟fair value model，因为需要rent out forrental
    gains，所以其实是investment property - cost or fair value method
    under IFRS.

> 3\. An analyst is comparing a firm to its competitors. The firm has a
> deferred tax liability that results from accelerated depreciation for
> tax purposes. The firm is expected to continue to grow in the

>
> A. It should be treated as equity at its full value.
>
> **B**. It should be treated as a liability at its full value.
>
> C. The present value should be treated as a liability with the
> remainder being treated as equity.

-   The DTL is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future because
    a growing firm is expected to continue to increase its investment in
    depreciable assets, and accelerated depreciation for tax on the
    newly acquired assets delays the reversal of the DTL. (Module 29.2,
    LOS 29.b)

> 10\. For analytical purposes, what is the impact on the debt-to-equity
> ratio if the market rate of interest increases after the bond is
> issued? A. An increase. B. A decrease. **C**. No change.

-   An increase in the market rate will decrease the price of a bond.
    For analytical purposes, adjusting the bond liability to its
    economic value will result in a lower debt-to-equity ratio (lower
    numerator and higher denominator). (Module 30.2, LOS 30.b)

>  
>
> 2\. The purpose of debt covenants is best described as:
>
> **A**. limiting issuance costs.
>
> B. preventing technical default.
>
> C. protecting the interests of creditors.

-   A bond is considered to be in "technical" default if the borrower
    violates the bond's covenants

>
> **B**. Collateral pledged as security in the event of default.
>
> C. The market rate of interest on the balance sheet date.

-   The market rate on the balance sheet date is not typically
    disclosed. The amount of debt principal scheduled to be repaid over
    the next five years and collateral pledged (if any) are generally
    included in the footnotes to the financial statements. (LOS 30.e)

>
> 2\. Under IFRS 16, a lease for a period of more than one year may be
> classified as an operating lease by: A. lessors only. B. lessees only.
> **C**. both lessors and lessees.

-   Under IFRS 16, lessors may classify leases as operating or finance
    leases, but lessees must treat all leases longer than one year as
    finance leases.(Module 30.4, LOS 30.h)

>
> 3\. At the beginning of 20X6, Cougar Corporation enters a finance
> lease requiring five annual payments of \$10,000 each beginning on the
> first day of the lease. Assuming the lease interest rate is 8%, the
> amount of interest expense recognized by Cougar in 20X6 is closest to:
>
> A. \$2,650. B. \$3,194. **C**. \$3,450.

-   At the inception of the lease, the present value of the lease
    payments is \$43,121 (BGN mode: N = 5, I = 8, PMT = 10,000, FV = 0,
    solve for PV). After the first payment is made, the balance of the
    lease liability is \$43,121 -- 10,000 principal payment = \$33,121.
    Interest expense for the first year is \$33,121 × 8% = \$2,650.
