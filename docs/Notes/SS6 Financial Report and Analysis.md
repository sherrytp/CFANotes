# READING 19. INTRODUCTION TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS

>  

##### LOS 21a: Describe the roles of financial reporting and financial statement analysis; 

-   Role of financial report is to provide financial information about
    the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential
    investors, leaders, and other creditors in making decisions about
    providing resources.

-   The ROLE of financial statement analysis is to use the information
    in FA, along with other info, to make economic decisions. (More
    about external users, but inner management also performs FA&FR)

##### B: describe the roles of the statement of financial position (balance sheet), statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and statement of cash flows in evaluating a company's performance and financial position;

-   BS, aka statement of financial position or statement of financial
    condition, reports the firm\'s financial position at the time.
    Assets = liabilities + owners\' equity. **BS presents a
    shareholder's residual claim on assets (residual interests on assets
    after deducting liability)**

-   Statement of comprehensive income reports changes in equity
    \[business activities\] except shareholders doing with stocks. Net
    income determined in the calculation of comprehensive income is a
    component of the change in retained earnings, but there are other
    changes that may also have occurred (the payment of dividends, for
    example) that are not included on the statement of comprehensive
    income.

-   ![](media/image1.png){width="6.875in" height="0.5729166666666666in"}

-   IS, aka statement of operations or profit and loss statement.
    Revenues = other Income - Expenses

-   Cash flows: operating, investing, financial

##### C: describe the importance of financial statement notes and supplementary information---including disclosures of accounting policies, methods, and estimates--- and management's commentary;

-   Footnotes to improve their assessments of the **amount, timing, and
    uncertainty \[accounting policies, methods, and estimates\]**
    reported:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Discuss the basis of presentation, eg fiscal period or inclusion of
    consolidated entities

-   Accounting methods, assumptions, estimates

> (SUMMARY: Business acquisitions or disposals, legal actions, employee
> benefits plan, contingencies or commitments, significant client, sales
> or segments)

-   financial instruments and risks arising from financial instruments,

-   commitments and contingencies,

-   legal proceedings,

-   related-party transactions,

-   subsequent events (i.e., events that occur after the balance sheet
    date),

-   business acquisitions and disposals, and

-   operating segments' performance

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Management\'s commentary aka management\'s report, operating and
    financial review, MD&A(discussion and analysis)**: nature of
    business, objectives, past performance, performance measures, key
    relationships, recourses and risk. **Maybe unaudited**. US SEC
    **requires trends, significant events, uncertainties that affect**
    firm\'s liquidity, capital resources, operations. Eg:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Inflation & price changing

-   Off-Balance-Sheet obligations and contractual obligations - purchase
    commitments

-   Accounting policies needs judgement

-   Forward-looing expenditures and divestitures

##### D: describe the objective of audits of financial statements, the types of audit reports, and the importance of effective internal controls;

-   Standard auditor\'s opinions: 1. independent, 2. GAAS, reasonable
    assurance of no material errors, 3. accepted and reasonable, with
    additional explanation. **Sarbanes--Oxley**

-   [**Unqualified** opinion (**clean** opinion): no material or
    errors]{.ul}

> [**Qualified** opinion: explains exceptions to the accounting
> principles]{.ul}
>
> [**Adverse** opinion: not fair or material]{.ul}
>
> **Disclaimer** of opinion: unable to express opinions in the case of a
> scope limitation

-   Internal control: process that company ensures it presents accurate
    FA, responsibility of management. US SEC requires auditors to
    express opinions on internal control, can separately or 4th element
    of standard opinion.

-   Auditor:

> 1\. Whereas the financial statements are prepared by management and
> are its responsibility, the auditor has performed an independent
> review.
>
> 2\. Generally accepted auditing standards were followed, thus
> providing reasonable assurance that the financial statements contain
> no material errors.
>
> 3\. The auditor is satisfied that the statements were prepared in
> accordance with accepted accounting principles and that the principles
> chosen and estimates made are reasonable. The auditor's report must
> also contain additional explanation when accounting methods have not
> been used consistently between periods.
>
> ![Unqualified Qualified Adverse Disclaimer of opinion • True and
> fairly presented • Clean opinion • Preferred by investors • Limited
> scope (incomplete records) • Exception from accounting standards •
> Explains degree and area of exception • Red flag on financial
> reporting quality • Material departure from accounting standards •
> Pervasive errors • Fraudulent or illegal activities • Unreliable
> financial statements • Unable to issue an opinion
> ](media/image2.png){width="3.34375in" height="2.25in"}

##### E: identify and describe information sources that analysts use in financial statement analysis besides annual financial statements and supplementary information; 

-   Quarterly or semiannual reports (10-Q, 10-K): not audited, but
    **update**. 8-K of acquisitions and disposal.

-   **Proxy** statements: issued to shareholders for voting, about
    election & qualifications of board members, compensation,
    management, issuance of stock options

-   Corporate reports, press release: public relations or sales
    materials

-   **Earnings guidance**, before FA, a conference all of senior
    management to answer questions

##### F: describe the steps in the financial statement analysis framework. 

-   State the objective and context

-   Gather data (ask questions about management, suppliers, customers)

-   Process the data (calculate ratios, prepare graphs and common-size
    BS)

-   Analyze and interpret the data (conclusions and recommendations)

-   Report the conclusions or recommendations (prepare report and talk,
    comply with code&standards)

-   Update the analysis (aka **follow-up**, repeat)

# READING 20. FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

>  

##### A: describe the objective of financial reporting and the importance of financial reporting standards in security analysis and valuation; 

-   To provide economic decision makers with useful info about financial
    performance and changes in financial positions. Reporting standards
    ensures diff firms are comparable, narrowing the range of reasonable
    estimates.

##### B: describe the roles of financial reporting standard-setting bodies and regulatory authorities in establishing and enforcing reporting standards; 

-   Standard-setting bodes: professional org of accountants and
    auditors, 1 FASB - GAAP, 2 IASB - IFRS/IAS

-   Regulatory authorities: SEC, FCA(UK), International Organization of
    Securities Commissions(IOSCO) - 1. protect investors, 2. ensure
    fairness efficiency transparency, 3. reduce systemic risk

-   10-K(needs audit), 10-Q, **DEF-14A (proxy)**, 8-K (disclose material
    events of acquisitions, disposals, changes in corp gov, security
    markets), 6-K(foreigner 10-Q), Form 144 (securities to qualified
    buyers without registering but notifying), Forms 3/4/5 (beneficial
    ownership)

>  

##### C: describe the International Accounting Standards Board's conceptual framework, including qualitative characteristics of financial reports, constraints on financial reports, and required reporting elements; 

-   Fundamental qualitative characteristics: 1. relevance (predictive
    value/confirmatory value or both, **materiality**), 2. faithful
    representation (complete, neutral, free from error)

-   Enhancing characteristics: 1. comparability (consistent among firms
    and over time), 2. **verifiability** (same - different knowledgeable
    and independent users would agree that the information presented
    faithfully represents the economic events that it is intended to
    represent), 3. timeliness (information is available to decision
    makers before information is stale), 4. understandability (useful
    info cannot be omitted cuz complicated)

-   Required reporting elements: assets, liabilities, equity - for
    measuring financial positions, income, expense - for measuring
    performance.

-   Amount reported depend on **measurement base**: historical cost,
    amortized cost (hist adjusted for depreciation, amortization,
    depletion, impairment), current cost, net **realizable** value (in
    an orderly disposal, estimated selling), present value (discounted
    value of expected FV), fair value.

-   **Constraints**: cost-benefit tradeoff, non-quantifiable reputation
    (Balancing of qualitative characteristics)

-   Assumptions: accrual accounting (at time actually occur), going
    concern (firm will continue)

##### D: describe general requirements for financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

-   Required FA: BS, comprehensive IS, Cash Flow (like use direct format
    of CFO), changes in owner\'s Equity, explanatory notes, including a
    summary of accounting policies

-   Features for preparing: fair presentation, going concern basis,
    accrual basis (used to prepare financial statements other than
    statement of cash flows), consistency, materiality (free of mis or
    omissions), aggregation of similar and separation of dissimilar, no
    offsetting, frequency, comparative info, classified BS (distinguish
    between current and past), **minimum** info shown, comparative info

-   Barriers to create a coherent FRF: valuation, standard setting
    (**principles-based IFRS**, rules-based, objectives-oriented blend
    two **GAAP**), measurement.

##### E: describe implications for financial analysis of alternative financial reporting systems and the importance of monitoring developments in financial reporting standards.

# READING 21. UNDERSTANDING INCOME STATEMENTS

>  

-   Describe the components of the income statement and alternative
    presentation formats of that statement

-   IFRS = GAAP similar: IS com be combined with other comprehensive
    income in a single one.

-   Net revenue = revenues - adjustments for estimated returns &
    allowances (aka turnover); Net Income (earnings, or \'bottom line\')
    = revenues - ordinary expenses + other income - other expenses +
    gains - losses

-   Noncontrolling interest (aka minority interest, minority owner\'s
    interest) of subsidiary\'s inc reported in parents\' companies IS,
    and needs to subtract calculating NI.

-   Describe general principles of revenue recognition and accounting
    standards for revenue recognition

-   Calculate revenue given information that might influence the choice
    of revenue recognition method

> Accounting standards - rev recognition, accrual acct, specific
> applications (accounting for long-term contracts, installment sales,
> barter transactions, gross and net reporting)

-   **IASB revenue**: 1. The risk and reward of ownership is
    transferred. 2. There is no continuing control or management over
    the goods sold. 3. Revenue can be reliably measured. 4. There is a
    probable flow of economic benefits. 5. The cost can be reliably
    measured. AND 1. The amount of revenue can be reliably measured. 2.
    There is a probable flow of economic benefits. 3. The stage of
    completion can be measured. 4. The cost incurred and cost of
    completion can be reliably measured.

-   **FASB revenue**: 1. realized or realizable, 2. earned; 1. There is
    evidence of an arrangement between the buyer and seller. 2. The
    product has been delivered or the service has been rendered. 3. The
    price is determined or determinable. 4. The seller is reasonably
    sure of collecting money.

-   **Unearned revenue**: liability (A/C)

-   **Long-term contracts**: percentage-of-completion(IFRS, GAAP) &
    completed-contract(GAPP), when project cannot be reliably estimated,
    No revenue, expense, or profit would be recognized, IFRS recognize
    at the end. Loss must be immediately record by IFRS & GAAP. Under
    IFRS, if the outcome of a project cannot be estimated reliably,
    revenue and expenses are recognized the same for Y1 (report x
    expenses and revenue in same amount) over the project's life but [no
    profit]{.ul} may be recorded until the project is completed.

-   ![](media/image6.png){width="6.875in" height="0.7604166666666666in"}

-   **Barter transaction** (non-monetary exchange, round-trip
    transaction): GAAP can be recognized at fair value only if
    historical cash, otherwise carrying value; IFRS must based on fair
    value from similar non-barter with unrelated parties.

-   Expenses: amounts incurred to generate rev, **COGS (grouping)**,
    operating expense, interest, taxes; 1.Cash method 2. **Accrual**

-   Bad debt and warranty expense: matching principle to estimate in the
    period of sale.

-   Describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis of
    non-recurring items (including discontinued operations, unusual or
    infrequent items) and changes in accounting policies

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Discontinued operation**: business must physically and
    operationally distinct from firm - separate report. **Measurement
    date**: formal plan of disposing of operation. Time in between is
    **phaseout period**. (estimated loss - accrue during phaseout and
    sale, expected gain cannot reported until complete sale) Analytical
    implication: not affect net income, but affect future cash flows.

-   **Unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence** items: gain or
    loss from sale of assets or part of business, which not ordinary
    operations; impairments, write-offs (of bad debt), write-downs,
    restructuring costs. Analytical implications: review to decide
    include or exclude.

-   **Extraordinary** items: US GAAP material transaction of both
    unusual and infrequent in occur, reported net of tax, after income
    from continuing operation, separately in IS; **[stop]{.ul}** after
    2015/12/15

-   **Changes in accounting principles**: from 1 GAAP or IFRS method to
    another (eg. From LIFO to FIFO), **retrospective application**.
    **Prior-period adjustments**: change of incorrect errors, restated
    to reflect. **Changes in accounting estimates**: from management of
    new info, applied prospectively. Under U.S. GAAP, a firm that
    changes to LIFO from another inventory cost method does not apply
    the change retrospectively, but instead uses the carrying value of
    inventory as the first LIFO layer. Analytical implications: changes
    not affect cash flows, but in estimate or principles need review to
    decide impact on future operations; error show weak of internal
    control.

-   Distinguish between the operating and non-operating components of
    the income statement

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   For financial firms, investment + financial exp = operating.
    Non-financial firms, nonoperating include dividends and interest
    from investment, securities, interest expense of capital structure.

```{=html}

```
-   Describe how earnings per share is calculated and calculate and
    interpret a company's earnings per share (both basic and diluted
    earnings per share) for both simple and complex capital structures

-   Distinguish between dilutive and antidilutive securities and
    describe the implications of each for the earnings per share
    calculation

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Earnings per share (**EPS**): most commonly profitability
    performance for public-traded, shares of common stock(aka ordinary
    stocks). **Simple capital structure** contain no ***potentially
    dilutive*** securities, only common stock + nonconvertible debt +
    nonconvertible preferred stock. **Complex capital structure**
    contain potentially dilutive securities(eg. Employee stock options,
    warrants, or convertible securities). - firms with complex must
    report **basic & diluted EPS**, **diluted EPS is [less]{.ul} than or
    equal to its basic EPS**(always remember to compare).

> Payment of a cash dividend on common shares is **NOT** considered in
> the calculation of EPS.

-   **Stock dividend**: distribution of additional shares, eg. 10% means
    holder of 100 shares receive 10 more shares. **Stock split**:
    division of \"old\" shares into \"new\"(post-split) shares, create
    more shares but price drops, eg. 100 shares will 200 shares for
    2-for-1 split, and 150 shares for 3-for-2-split. - SO proportional
    ownership NOT CHANGED, same % of shares outstanding with more
    shares: a 50% stock dividend and a 3-for-2 stock split both result
    in three \'new\' shares for every two "old" shares.

> For EPS calculation purposes, a stock split is treated as if it

-   If the exercise price is greater than the weighted average market
    price, the effect of their conversion is anti-dilutive. Any
    **antidilutive** effect of a convertible security only relates to
    the calculation of EPS, antidilutive is not part of the distinction
    of [simple vs. complex capital structure]{.ul}.

-   A Diluted EPS Calculation Using If-Converted Method for Convertible
    Debt Company O(fictitious) reported net income of \$750,000 for year
    ended 31 December 2018. The company had a weighted average of
    690,000 shares of common stock outstanding. In addition, it has only
    one potentially dilutive security: \$50,000 of 6 percent convertible
    bonds, convertible into a total of 10,000 shares. Assuming a tax
    rate of 30 percent, calculate Company O\'s basic and diluted EPS.

> The options would no longer be outstanding; instead, 30,000 shares of

> assume that shares would be repurchased with the cash received upon
> exercise of the options. At an average market price of \$55 per share,
> the \$1 proceeds from option exercise, the company could have
> repurchased 19,091 shares. Therefore, the incremental number of shares
> issued is 10,909 (calculated as 30,000 minus 19,091). For the diluted
> EPS calculation, no change is made to the numerator. As shown in
