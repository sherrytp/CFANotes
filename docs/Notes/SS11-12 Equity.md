> Which of the following is most similar to a short position in the
> underlying asset?
>
> A. Buying a put. **B**. Writing a put. C. Buying a call.

-   Buying a put is most similar to a short position in the underlying
    asset because the put increases in value if the underlying asset
    value decreases. The writer of a put and the holder of a call have a
    long exposure to the underlying asset because their positions
    increase in value if the underlying asset value increases. (Module
    44.2, LOS 44.e)
