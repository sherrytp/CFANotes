# READING 42. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES: DEFINATION 

>  

A.  Describe basic features of a fixed-income security

-   Bond price, yields, ratings:

    -   Issuers of bonds

        -   Original maturity longer than 1yr is **capital market
            security**.

        -   Surety bond: reimbues investors for any loss incurred if
            default.

        -   Consol: no stated maturity date.

        -   Covered bond: debt obligation backed by a segregated pool of
            assets(cover pool), so when collateral non-performing,
            issuer must replace it.

        -   Equipment trust certificate: bonds secured by specific types
            of equipment or physical assets, such as shipping
            containers.

    -   Bond maturity: **tenor**(time remaining until maturity)

    -   Par value

    -   Coupon payment

        -   plain vanilla of fixed coupon rate

        -   **Pure discount** bonds of zero-coupon bond: earn on implied
            basis

    ```{=html}

    ```
    -   Currencies

B.  Describe content of a bond indenture

C.  Compare affirmative and negative covenants and identify examples of
    each

    height="0.3854166666666667in"}

    -   Issuing entities: structured finance sector, not corporate

    -   Sources of repayment

    -   Collateral and credit enhancement

-   Trust deed/bond indenture : legal contact between the bond issuers
    (borrower) and bondholders (lender). The provisions in the bond
    indenture = covenants:

    -   **Negative** covenants: prohibitions on the borrower

    -   **Affirmative** covenants: actions the borrower promises to
        perform

-   Internal credit enhancement: subordination(aka credit tranching,),
    overcollateralization, reserve accounts/funds; external: a letter of
    credit, surety bond, cash collateral account.

-   Describe how legal, regulatory, and tax considerations affect the
    issuance and trading of fixed-income securities

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   **Eurobonds** -typically bearer bonds(no trustee owner):
    international bond issued outside jurisdiction of any one country
    and not denominated in the currency of issue country. **Foreign**
    bonds: debt securities issued in domestic market by
    foreign-domiciled issuers. **Global** bonds: issued simultaneously
    in Eurobond market and at least a domestic market.

-   Describe how cash flows of fixed-income securities are structured

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Principal repayment structures: **bullet** bond(**plain vanilla**):
    entire payment of principal at maturity; **amortizing** bond:
    periodic payments of interest and repayments of principal -
    **fully** and **partially**(fixed periodic pmt but only a portion of
    principal repaid by maturity, thus a **balloon** payment required at
    maturity to retire the outstanding principal amount).

-   **Sink fund** arrangements: to periodically to retire bond\'s
    principal outstanding, segregate cash reserve to repay of bond\'s
    trustee, reduce credit risk. [COUPON structures]{.ul}:

    -   **Floor** of lowest to prevent reference rate falls below min.

            conversion value

        v.  Conversion parity: conversion price = convertible bond\'s
            price; positive premium means **below** parity

-   **Par** curve: par bond yield curve, a sequence of YTM that each
    bond is priced at par; not calculated from actual bonds YTM but
    constructed from the spot curve of same credit risk. Shows

-   Compare, calculate, and interpret yield spread measures

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Yield spread: difference between the yields of 2 different bonds,
    quoted in basis points

    -   Benchmark spread, G-spread (actual or interpolated gov treasury)

    -   Special G-spread: don\'t match an on-the-run(mostly recent) gov
        bond but quoted relative to an \"interpolated gov bond yield\"

    -   **I-spread** (aka Interpolated spreads): over standard interest
        swap rate of same tenor

    -   Asset swap: converts periodic fixed coupon to a [LIBOR ± spread
        (measure credit risk)]{.ul}

    -   Zero-volatility, z-spread: shape of benchmark yield curve,
        constant yield over govnm or interest rate swap spot curve.

    -   Option-adjusted spread (**OAS**) = Z-spread - option value (in
        basis points per year): callable bond: ZS>OAS; puttable bond:
        ZS\<OAS.

    -   Comparison: if bond\'s spread higher, undervalued; lower means
        overvalued.

    -   Percentage price change is greater (in absolute value) when
        market discount rate goes down than goes up.
