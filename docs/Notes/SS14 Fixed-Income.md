# READING 45. Asset-backed Securities

 

A.  Explain benefits of securitization for economies and financial
    markets

B.  Describe securitization, including the parties involved in the
    process and the roles they play

C.  Describe typical structures of securitizations, including credit
    tranching and time tranching

-   ABS Issue entity: structured finance sector, not corporate

-   **Securitization**: benefits to investor: managed credit risk
    exposure, complex structure; benefits to investors: can expose to a
    wider range of assets. Parties: seller, SPE(issue ABS), servicer of
    loans(responsible for payment collection and recovery default); all
    other underwriters, rating agencies, financial guarantors are third
    parties.

-   Internal **subordination**(aka **credit tranching**): redistribute
    credit risk associate w collateral, so investors can choose credit
    risk they bear. Time tranching: diff expected maturities, cuz
    repayment risk(uncertainty of cash flows not scheduled, extension &
    contraction risk).

-   Absolute priority rule holds in bankruptcy liquidation, violates
    bankruptcy reorganization.

D.  Describe types and characteristics of residential mortgage loans
    that are typically securitized

-   Loan-to-value ratio(LTV): mortgage amount to property\'s value,
    lower LTV higher equity. **Mortgage** rate(aka contract, note):
    fixed, adjustable/variable, initial period fix, convertible.
    Recourse loan: lender has claim against borrower for any shortfall;
    Non-recourse loan: no claim but only the sale of property to recover
    outstanding mortgage.

-   Bullet(interest-only lifetime) mortgage: no scheduled principal
    repmt, payback \@maturity.

-   **Agency RMBS**: by federal agency & GSE(government-sponsored
    enterprise); **Non**-agency RMBS: private entities. If not meeting
    agency RMBS, it\'s a non-conforming mortgage.

E.  Describe types and characteristics of residential mortgage-backed
    securities, including mortgage pass-through securities and
    collateralized mortgage obligations, and explain the cash flows and
    risks for each type

-   **Pass**-**through** created when holders form a pool of mortgages
    and sell shares/certificates in pool; pass-through rate=coupon -
    serve. Weighted avg coupon rate(WAC), weighted avg maturity(WAM),
    weighted avg life, prepayment measure of CPR(annualized SSM single).

F.  Define prepayment risk and describe the prepayment risk of
    mortgage-backed securities

-   Collagenized mortgage obligation (**CMO**): securitization of a pool
    of mortgage pass-thru loans. Sequential pay CMO: each tranche
    retired sequentially; Panned Amortization Class (PAC CMO):
    predictivity of cash flows following repayment rate; **PCA tranche**
    has less variability in avg life, **support tranche** has more
    variability in avg life and can offer higher return bearing
    prepayment risks(contraction & extension), all compared to mortgage
    pass-thru securities. CMO and commercial mortgage-backed securities
    are back by mortgages only.

G.  Describe characteristics and risks of commercial mortgage-backed
    securities(**CMBS**)

H.  Describe types and characteristics of non-mortgage asset-backed
    securities, including the cash flows and risks of each type

    height="0.9479166666666666in"}

I.  Describe collateralized debt obligations, including their cash flows
    and risks

-   Collateralized debt obligation (**CDO**) are structured securities
    **backed by a pool of debt obligations** that is managed by a
    collateral manager. ABS collateralize underlying pool of assets; MBS
    collateralize a pool of mortgage-backed securities. CDO worries
    additionally manager fails to earn enough returns to pay senior &
    mezzanine tranches. CDO includes:

-   Collateralized bond obligations (CBOs) backed by corporate and
    emerging market debt.

-   Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) backed by leveraged bank
    loans.

-   **Structured** finance CDOs backed by residential or commercial MBS,
    ABS, or other CLOs.

-   **Synthetic** CDOs backed by credit default swaps on structured
    securities.

 

# READING 46. Understanding Fixed Income Risk and Return 

 

A.  Calculate and interpret the sources of return from investing in a
    fixed-rate bond

-   1.Coupon and principle payments, 2.Reinvestment of coupon payments,
    3.Capital gains or loss if bond is sold before maturity. A point on
    **trajectory** represents the carrying value of the bond at that
    time.

B.  Define, calculate, and interpret Macaulay, modified, and effective
    durations

-   ![](media/image3.png){width="5.833333333333333in"
    height="1.0520833333333333in"}

-   **Duration gap** = Macaulay duration - investment horizon.

  -------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------
  Investment horizon =       Reinvestment risk offsets price risk

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C.  Explain why effective duration is the most appropriate measure of
    interest rate risk for bonds with embedded options

D.  Define key rate duration and describe the use of key rate durations
    in measuring the sensitivity of bonds to changes in the shape of the
    benchmark yield curve

E.  Explain how a bond's maturity, coupon, and yield level affect its
    interest rate risk

F.  Calculate the duration of a portfolio and explain the limitations of
    portfolio duration

G.  Calculate and interpret the money duration of a bond and price value
    of a basis point (PVBP)

H.  Calculate and interpret approximate convexity and distinguish
    between approximate and effective convexity

I.  Estimate the percentage price change of a bond for a specified
    change in yield, given the bond's approximate duration and convexity

J.  Describe how the term structure of yield volatility affects the
    interest rate risk of a bond

K.  Describe the relationships among a bond's holding period return, its
    duration, and the investment horizon

L.  Explain how changes in credit spread and liquidity affect
    yield-to-maturity of a bond and how duration and convexity can be
    used to estimate the price effect of the changes

Note: The increase in value of a zero-coupon bond over its life is
interest income. A zero-coupon bond has no reinvestment risk over life.
A bond held to maturity has no capital gain or loss.

 

Sources of return from a bond investment include:

-   Coupon and principle payments (so-called interest income for
    zero-coupon)

-   Reinvestment of coupon payments

-   Capital gain or loss [if bond is sold before maturity]{.ul}

△YTM produce market price risk (uncertainty about a bond\'s price,
short-term) and reinvestment risk (uncertainty about income from
reinvesting coupon payments, long-term).

When the YTM of a callable bond falls, the increase in price is less
than for an option-free bond because both bond price and the value of
the call option increase.

> Callable bond value = straight bond value - call option value
