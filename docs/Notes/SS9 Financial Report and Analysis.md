    sustainability of earnings, cash flows, BS.

    effectiveness of discipline reporting quality\], internal control,
    private contracts.

7\. Under IFRS, a firm that presents a nonstandard financial measure is
least likely required to:

A. provide the same measure for at least two prior periods.

**B**. explain the reasons for presenting the nonstandard measure.

C. reconcile the nonstandard measure to a comparable standard measure.

-   IFRS require a firm that presents a nonstandard financial measure to
    reconcile that measure to an IFRS measure and explain why the firm
    believes the nonstandard measure is relevant to users of the
    financial statements. Presenting the nonstandard measure for prior
    periods is not a requirement. (LOS 31.g)

4\. Which of the following stock screens is most likely to identify
stocks with high earnings growth rates?

A. Dividend payout ratio greater than 30%.

**B**. Price to cash flow per share ratio less than 12.

C. Book value to market value ratio less than 25%.

-   Firms with high growth rates will tend to have high market values to
    book value of equity. Low price to cash flow (P/CF, P/BV, P/E)
    ratios would tend to identify value stocks rather than growth
    stocks. Screening for high dividend payout ratios would tend to
    identify mature firms with relatively few growth opportunities.
