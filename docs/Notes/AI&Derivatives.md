A credit derivative is a class of derivative contracts between two
parties, a credit protection buyer and a credit protection seller, in
which the latter provides protection to the former against a specific
credit loss.

 

Total return swap: buyer - pay all returns on int+principal + any
changes in bond\'s market value

> Seller - pay either a fixed or floating int rate

Credit spread option on diff between bond\'s yield and yield on a
benchmark default-free bond

> Buyer - pay option premium on the desired strike spread
>
> Seller - pay established payoff

bond/loan defaults, the principal payoff is reduced accordingly

the payments made by the debt securities such that prepayments or credit
losses are allocated to the most-junior tranches first and most-senior
tranches last.
