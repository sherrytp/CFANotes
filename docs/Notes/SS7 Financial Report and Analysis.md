# READING 22. UNDERSTANDING BALANCE SHEETS 

>  

A.  Describe the elements of the balance sheet: assets, liabilities, and
    equity

-   The balance sheet (also known as the statement of financial position
    or statement of financial condition) reports the firm's financial
    position at a point in time, consisting- **Assets**: Resources
    controlled as a result of past transactions that are expected to
    provide future economic benefits. BS omits important aspects of a
    company's ability to generate future cash flows, such as its
    [reputation and management]{.ul} skills, so differs from market
    value of shareholders' equity. **Liabilities**: Obligations as a
    result of past events that are expected to require an outflow of
    economic resources. **Equity, aka \"net assets\"**: The owners'
    residual interest in the assets after deducting the liabilities.

B.  Describe uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial
    analysis

-   Used to asses a firm\'s ability to make distributions to
    shareholders and **liquidity** (ability to meet short-term
    obligations) and **solvency** (ability to meet long-term
    obligations).

> The balance sheet elements (assets, liabilities, and equity) should
> [NOT]{.ul} be interpreted as [market value or intrinsic value]{.ul},
> but historical cost, amortized cost or [fair]{.ul} current value.

-   Describe alternative formats of balance sheet presentation

-   Beginning of year, Company P purchased 1,000 shares of Company S for
    \$80 per share. During year, Company S paid a dividend of \$4 per
    share. At the end of the year, Company S's share price was \$75.
    Both trading securities and available-for-sale securities are
    reported [SAME]{.ul} on the balance sheet at their fair values. At
    year-end, the fair value is \$75,000 \[\$75 per share × 1,000
    shares\]. For IS: a loss of \$1,000 is recognized if securities are
    considered trading securities (\$4 dividend × \$1,000 shares) --
    (\$5 unrealized loss × 1,000 shares); if investment is
    available-for-sale, \$4,000 \[\$4 dividend × \$1,000\].

    however, market cost? cannot be greater than net realizable value or
    less than net realizable value less a normal profit margin. If net
    realizable value (IFRS) or market (U.S. GAAP) is less than the
    inventory's carrying value, the inventory is written down & loss in
    IS, [write-up is allowed in IFRS but not US GAAP]{.ul}.

    ratio(aka acid-test ratio) excludes inventory from CA; Cash ratio
    excludes inventory &A/R. **Solvency** ratios([long]{.ul}-term

# READING 23. UNDERSTANDING CASH FLOW STATEMENTS

>  

-   Compare cash flows from operating, investing, and financing
    activities and classify cash flow items as relating to one of those
    three categories given a description of the items

-   CFS provides Information about a company's cash receipts and cash
    payments during an accounting period; An understanding of the impact
    of accrual accounting events on cash flows; liquidity, solvency,
    flexibility.

    -   CFO operating: transactions of net income effect\[IS, BS\] Inv
        interest, received dividends, paid interest; changes in working
        capital \[current assets/current liabilities\] less than 1yr
        replace in CFO not CFI.

    -   CFI investing\[BS\]: acquisition or disposal of long-term assets
        & certain investment\[[gross]{.ul} asset account in BS\]
        Acquisition of debt & equity (not trading securities) loans
        paid; IFRS either-or flexible, US GAAP:

> ![Operating Activities Inflows Cash collected from customers Interest

-   Distinguish between the direct and indirect methods of presenting

    each method

```
-   CF from investing and financing SAME, but operating differ.
    **Direct** method: accrual-basis IS convert into cash-basis
    receipts/payments. **Indirect** method: net income converted to
    operating CF by adjustments - noncash(depreciation, amortization),
    nonoperating(gains & losses), accrual changes in BS. **Comparison**:
    direct method is easier understanding past cash flows; but indirect
    gives only the differ between NI & CFO,

> indirect method prepares less costly, mirrors forecasting approach
> based on NI & BS for future income.
