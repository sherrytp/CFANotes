D.  Calculate and explain how inflation and deflation of inventory costs
    affect the financial statements and ratios of companies that use
    different inventory valuation methods

E.  Explain LIFO reserve and LIFO liquidation and their effects on
    financial statements, ratios

F.  Convert a company's reported financial statements from LIFO to FIFO
    for purposes of comparison

    height="0.19791666666666666in"}

I.  Describe the financial statement presentation of and disclosures
    relating to inventories

-   Disclosures in footnotes: inventory methods, total carrying value by
    classification = fair value - selling cost, COGS, inventory
    write-downs and reversals(IFRS only cuz GAAP Xallow)

    -   Change in methods: Under IFRS, the firm must demonstrate that
        the change will provide reliable and more relevant information.
        Under U.S. GAAP, the firm must explain why the change in cost
        flow method is preferable. Exception-change to LIFO

# READING 26. LONG-LIVED ASSETS

 

A.  Distinguish between costs that are capitalized and costs that are
    expensed in the period in which they are incurred

-   ![](media/image7.png){width="6.197916666666667in" height="1.6875in"}

B.  Compare intangible assets: purchased, internally developed, acquired
    in business combination

-   **IFRS identifiable** intangible assets: can be separated from firm
    or from contractual legal right, controlled by firm, expected to
    provide future economic benefits\[probable, measurable\].
    **Unidentifiable**: cannot be purchased separately with indefinite
    life, eg. Goodwill (purchase price - fair value of identifiable, net
    of liabilities acquired).

D.  Describe the different depreciation methods for property, plant, and
    equipment and calculate depreciation expense

-   Carrying (book) value = Historical cost\[purchase price + delivery +
    installation, gross invest\] - accumulated depreciation.
    Straight-line, accelerated, double-declining, units-of-production
    methods. IFRS requires **component depreciation**, while GAAP allows
    but rarely use.

E.  Describe how the choice of depreciation method and assumptions
    concerning useful life and residual value affect depreciation
    expense, financial statements, and ratios

F.  Describe different **amortization** methods for intangible assets
    with finite lives and calculate amortization expense: same above
    straight-line, accelerated DDB, check useful life time.

G.  Describe how the choice of amortization method and assumptions
    concerning useful life and residual value affect amortization
    expense, financial statements, and ratios

> the asset class is \$1.5 million above its carrying value. This upward
> revaluation will be reported as a Sl million gain on the income
> statement (to reverse the previously recorded loss on the income
> statement) and a \$0.5 million increase in the revaluation surplus
> account that does not affect income, but increases equity directly. On
> December 31, 20X3, Parsons determines that the fair market value of

I.  Explain the **impairment** of property, plant, and equipment and
    intangible assets

-   IFRS: annual asses impairment=carrying(cost-accu. Dep) >
    **recoverable amount(Fair Value -selling cost [or]{.ul} value in
    use\[PV of CFs\])**, or significant circumstances in market value
    change, write-down to recoverable\[GAAP fair\] on BS, impairment
    loss in IS limited reversal of write-up.

-   US GAAP: only impairment when circumstances cannot recover carrying
    value, 1.recoverability test: carrying>future undiscounted CFs,
    2.loss in IS measure=carrying-fair(or discounted PVCF).

> ![The carrying value of the equipment is \$900,000 original cost
> \$100,000 accumulated depreciation = \$800,000, and the recoverable
> amount under IFRS is \$785,000 (greater of \$785,000 value in use and
> \$760,000 fair value less selling costs). Under IFRS, the asset is
> written down on the balance sheet to the \$785,000 recoverable amount,
> and a \$15,000 loss (\$800,000 carrying value --- \$785,000
> recoverable amount) is recognized in the income statement. Under U.S.
> GAAP, the asset is impaired because the \$795,000 expected future cash
> flows is less than the \$800,000 carrying value. The asset is written

    height="0.3854166666666667in"}

J.  Explain the derecognition of property, plant, and equipment and
    intangible assets

-   When sold, gain/loss = actual selling price - carrying\[original
    cost - accu. Dep - impair\] in IS, CFI. When exchanged for other
    asset, carrying BV of exchanged=fair value if cannot truly
    estimated.

K.  Explain and evaluate how impairment, revaluation, and derecognition
    of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets affect
    financial statements and ratios

L.  Describe the financial statement presentation of and disclosures
    relating to property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets

-   IFRS disclosures: o Basis for measurement (usually historical cost).

    -   Gross carrying value and accumulated depreciation.

    -   Reconciliation of carrying amounts from beginning to end.

    -   Title restrictions and assets pledged as collateral.

    -   Agreements to acquire PP&E in the future(eg. Agreement to
        construction contract other).

        -   Revaluation (fair value) model is used: date, how fair value
            decided, carrying value

    -   Intangible assets w finite or indefinite lives

    -   Amount of impairment losses and reversal by asset [class]{.ul}.

    -   Where losses and loss reversals recognized in IS.

    -   Circumstances that cause the impairment loss or reversal.

-   US GAAP disclosures:

    -   Depreciation methods and expense by period.

    -   Accumulated depreciation by major classes or in total.

    -   Balances classes by nature and function i.e. land, improvements,
        machinery, furniture.

E.  Evaluate the effect of tax rate changes on a company's financial
    statements and ratios

> ![A firm purchases equipment for \$24,000 that has a three-year useful
> life. The firm depreciates the equipment using the straight-line
> method for financial reporting and double-declining balance for tax
> reporting. The tax rate is 40% in the first year, but in the second
> year, the expected tax rate decreases to 35%. Calculate the deferred
> tax liability in each year of the asset\'s life. Answer: The carrying
> value and tax base of the asset are shown in the following table:
> Straight-line depreciation Carrying value DDB depreciation Tax base
> Carrying value minus tax base Year 1 \$8,000 516,000 S16,ooo ss,ooo
> \$8,000 Year 2 \$8,000 \$8,000 \$5,333 \$2,667 \$5,333 Year 3 ,ooo
> \$2,667 The deferred tax liability is equal to the expected tax rate
> times the difference between the carrying value and the tax base. In
> Year 1, the expected tax rate was 40% and the DTL was 40% x \$8,000 =
> \$3,200. In Year 2, the expected tax rate changed to 35% and the DTL

I.  Explain recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax
    items

J.  Analyze **disclosures** relating to deferred tax items and the
    effective tax rate reconciliation and explain how information
    included in these disclosures affects a company's financial
    statements and financial ratios

-   DTL results from using [accelerated depreciation]{.ul} for tax
    purposes and normal for financial

-   [Impairments]{.ul} resulting in DTA, cuz write-down is immediate but
    tax deduction will wait till sold.

-   [Restructuring]{.ul} generates DTA, cuz costs recognized for
    financial but not tax deductible until paid. Note significant cash
    outflows(net of tax savings) in the years after restructuring costs
    report.

-   ![](media/image28.png){width="6.09375in" height="0.1875in"}

-   Post-employment benefits, deferred compensation: DTA reversing to
    tax deductible until paid.

```{=html}

-   [Available-for-sale]{.ul} marketable securities of unrealized
    gain/loss reflect on shareholders\' equity: DTL

-   Unrecognized DTL for undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and
    joint ventures

-   Current-year tax effect of each type of temporary difference

-   Reconciliation of reported income tax expense and tax expense based
    on statutory rate

-   Tax loss carryforwards and credits

# READING 28.NON-CURRENT (LONG-TERM) LIABILITIES 

 

A.  Determine the initial recognition, initial measurement and
    subsequent measurement of bonds

B.  Describe the effective interest method and calculate interest
    expense, amortization of bond discounts/premiums, and interest
    payments

-   Zero-coupon bond (aka pure-discount) makes no periodic interest
    payments. 3yr, YTM=12%, with a par value of \$1,000; calculate
    interest expense and BV using effective interest method?

> Interest expense reported in IS = market\*BV of bond BS liability; but
> interest rate and book value of bond liability are calculated using
> bond\'s yield at issue time, not current yield. At any point in time,
> BV of bond liability=PV of remaining future cash flows (coupon pmt &
> face value).

C.  Explain the **derecognition** of debt

-   **Issuance costs**: initial bond liability reduced by legal
    accounting fees, printing costs, commission; are treated as
    unamortized discount on BS, but net against bond proceeds cash
    inflows as CFF under IFRS, GAAP more flexible.

-   **Redeem** before maturity cuz low interest rate: a gain/loss
    recognized in continuing operations IS = BV of bond liability -
    redemption price at reacquisition date; CFF.

D.  Describe the role of **debt covenants** in protecting creditors

-   **Operating lease**: rental arrangement, A/L not reported by lessee,
    periodic lease=rental expense.

H.  Explain the financial reporting of leases from a lessor's
    perspective - chapter+p224

-   Under IFRS, **finance lease**: "transfers substantially all the
    risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an underlying asset",
    lessor derecognizes the underlying leased asset, and recognizes a
    lease receivable, and recognizes selling profit where applicable.
    **Operating leases**: lessor derecognizes underlying asset and
    recognizes lease receipts as income&BS lease invest/R.

-   Under US GAAP, a lessor classifies a finance lease in one of three
    categories: **sales-type**(PV of lease payment>carrying value),
    **direct financing**(PV pmt=carrying), or **operating**; IFRS x
    diff. The lessor's classification and accounting for operating
    leases under US GAAP is similar to that under IFRS. For both
    sales-type and direct financing leases, the lessor derecognizes the
    underlying asset and recognizes a lease receivable; however, the
    lessor recognizes selling profit only if the lease is considered a
    sales-type lease. For **lessee** accounting, the distinction between
    finance leases and operating leases exists in US GAAP but not in
    IFRS.

-   Operating lease is an off-balance-sheet, cuz appear neither in A
    nor L. Adjustment for operating leases is to treat them as capital
    leases by estimating present value of future lease obligations and
    adding that value to the firm's liabilities and long-lived assets.
    In finance lease, inception of lease is lower of PV of future min
    lease pmt or fair value of leased asset; interest rate used by
    lessee is lower of incremental borrowing rate or lessor\'s implicit
    rate; interest CFO, principal CFF

I.  Compare presentation and disclosure of defined contribution and
    defined benefit pension plans

-   Under both IFRS and US GAAP, companies must report the difference
    between the defined benefit pension obligation and the pension
    assets as an asset or liability on the balance sheet. An
    **underfunded** (fair value of plan\'s asset > estimated pension
    obligation) defined benefit pension plan is shown as a non-current
    net pension liability. **Defined contribution plan**: amount of
    contribution into the plan is specified (i.e., defined) and the
    amount of pension that is ultimately paid by the) plan (received by
    the retiree depends on the performance of the plan's assets, payment
    record as pension expense. **Defined benefit plan**: amount of
    pension ultimately paid by the plan (received by the retiree) is
    defined to a formula; actuarial gain/loss report as OCmpInc in BS
    and interest expense accrued on begin net pension obligation is
    profit/loss in IS.

J.  Calculate and interpret leverage and coverage ratios

> When evaluating solvency, accounts payable and accrued liabilities
> aren\'t considered debt, only calculate interest bear obligation:
> notes payable, LT debt. Fixed charge coverage refers to ratios.
