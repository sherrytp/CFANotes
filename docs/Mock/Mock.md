2.  Professionalism: A)knowledge of the law, B)Independence and
    objectivity, C)Misrepresentation, D)Misconduct; VII(A) Conduct as

6.  Disclosing grading information with other ones outside the process
    is violation, but if you read from a social media post and talk
    about it OKAY.

15. **Soft dollar** brokerage is practice of using a portion of
    brokerage commissions to purchase investment research and related
    services; therefore, duty of loyalty to use such assets for benefit
    of the client. Paying a higher-than-normal commission rate for the
    exclusive purpose of generating soft dollar commissions \[same
    service\] without commensurate is violation.

16. Participation in **private placements** or **IPO** should be
    s**trictly limited to special** situation in which there is no
    potential for even the appearance of conflicts of interest, so the
    violation is in appearance of impropriety. Another concern is that
    once the private placement goes public, there is incentive to offer
    buying for clients.

19. As long as the higher levels of service must not disadvantage or
    negatively affect other clients, and disclosed & available to all
    clients and prospective clients. So the fair approach should be
    offering all clients the same chance to participate in higher.

21. GIPS 9 sections: fundamentals of compliance, input data, calculation
    methodology, composite construction, disclosure, presentation and
    reporting, real estate (except publicly traded securities,
    commercial mortgage-backed securities, private debt investments),
    **private equity (venture capital)**, wrap fee/SMA portfolios.

23. Must assess the suitability of each client and gather info about
    specific investment goals, constraints, risk tolerance; otherwise
    investing violates.

72. US GAAP classifies all property as PP&E, while IFRS defines a
    separate classification of investment property: either **cost**
    model(BV-accumulated depreciation) or **fair value** model, which
    any change to fair value reflect in Net Income IS. **Revaluation**
    model applies only to PP&E, while upward revaluation of initial is
    recognized as revaluation surplus (gain) in OCI, subsequent upward
    revaluation is recognized on IS to previous recognized loss, and
    gain excess is revaluation surplus; download revaluation of initial
    is loss in IS, subsequent download reduces revaluation surplus
    first, and then recognized as loss.

76. Intangible assets can be obtained externally (capitalize costs) or
    internally, but R&D needs to expensed or capitalized; IFRS expense

    costs for software R&D if technical feasibility proven.

85. Comparative advantages: calculate the opportunity costs of producing
    a good in terms of the forgone production of another good.

86. Early expansion phase:

    -   Business begin to replenish inventories

    -   Consumers start spending more, particularly on housing and
        durable goods, as income stabilize

    -   GDP moves from negative to modestly positive

    -   Central banks generally keep low interest rate to support
        expanding

    -   Unemployment levels decline but remain high, slow layoffs but
        employers are reluctant to new hire without evidence of
        sustained economic growth.

    budgeting: conventionally equivalent =WACC, assuming 1.project is of

9.  **Elliott** Wave Theory: framework forecasting stock price movement,

    downward movements called **corrective** waves. Wave retracements,
    which mark a reversal in a price trend, follows **Fibonacci
    ratios**, not #.

35. Investors replicate assets using **derivatives** and risk-free
    assets, and create riskless positions using derivatives and
    underlying assets; thus derivative valuation is based on
    arbitrage-free pricing and risk neutrality, all bc **replication**.

36. Under **semi-strong** form of Efficient Market Hypothesis(EMH),
    net-of-fees returns from passive management will outperform active
    portfolio management (more frequent trading to exploit perceived
    inefficiencies, such as earnings surprise, so incurring high
    transaction costs and information acquisition cost). Neither
    technical (historical price) nor fundamental analysis can generate
    abnormal returns, unless insider info.

52. Internal credit enhancement: subordination (time tranching to
    mitigate prepayment risk, credit tranching - waterfall structure of
    senior have priority), overcollateralization (pledge assets to
    borrowed), reserve account.

63. Limitations of grouping companies by **business cycle sensitivity
    classification**: phase of business cycle occur at diff times in
    diff countries, so economic performance; industry classification
    labels are discrete (cyclical or noncyclical), sensitivity of
    relative description along a continuum. Although certain companies
    grow revenue during all phases of the business cycle, it\'s not a
    limitation of the schedule since it doesn\'t affect the sensitivity
    of a company\'s revenue and profits to the cycle; eg. Both cyclical
    and noncyclical companies can considered growth companies.

64. Benefits of derivative (futures) market: 1.market efficiency:
    requires less capital, low transaction costs, selling or short
    easier, so capital flows faster into the markets; 2. risk transfer:
    improves risk allocation and management; 3. information discovery:
    price adjust rapidly, price discovery informs the spot markets to
    avoid uncertainty.

71. Price multiple is justified forward P/E, price in numerator is
    typically based on **present value** calculation (discounted CF,
    discounted dividends) and denominator based on a near-term estimate
    of fundamental variable. Trailing P/E use current stock price /
    earnings of previous 12mo fundamental; cross-sectional comparison of
    companies\' P/E relies on law of one price, that stock of similar
    companies should be similarly priced/valued using current market
    price relative to respective current fundamentals.

79. Established alternative managers during due diligence with a
    performance fee structure should align interests between investor
    and manager, risks include closing a fund after suffering a loss and
    raising more capital than investment strategy can support; usually
    the performance fee structure aligns interests between investors and
    managers.

80. Swaps-price: initial value of 0 in contract by set fixed rate so PV
    of payments from counterparty are equal; -value determined after
    initiation by diff between PV of fixed and floating payments,
    affected by changes in market conditions and by fluctuating values
    of underlying.

81. Reporting net asset value(NAV): average quote (bid+ask)/2 to value
    publicly traded securities. But inappropriate to take \"haircut\"
    discount on publicly traded securities due to underlying liquidity
    issues, trading NAV okay.
