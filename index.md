An Obsidian vault to store my preparation notes for CFA exam

## Obsidian Notes

The `index.md` in the `/docs` folder is the homepage you see here.

The folders in `/Notes` appear as the main sections on the navigation bar.

The notes appear as pages within these sections. For example, [[Mock]] in `Mock`. 

Publish your public notes with [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
